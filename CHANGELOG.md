## [0.3.1-preview] - 2025-06-11

### üéâ Major Features Added
- **Audio System Overhaul**: Complete rewrite of audio management system 
- **Comprehensive Character System**: Added a reusable and extensible character framework.  
  - Base character classes (`Character`, `PlayerCharacter`, `NonPlayableCharacter`).
  - Component-based design for Health, Stats, and other character aspects.
  - `CharacterFactory` for streamlined creation of different character types (Player, Enemy, NPC).
  - Robust Data Persistence integration (`PersistableCharacterComponent`, `CharacterPersistenceManager`, specialized `CharacterSaveData`).
  - Support for object pooling of characters via `CharacterFactory`.
  - Interface-driven design (`IPersistableCharacter`, `ICombatant`, `IDamageable`, `ICharacterAI`, `IInteractable`, `IMovable`) for flexibility.
  - Hooks for AI and custom behaviors.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements
- **Service Locator Pattern**: Implemented comprehensive dependency injection
